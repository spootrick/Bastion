\section{Scope}
 \begin{flushleft}
  Today's era consuming is essential for human beings, producing garbage every minute and it leaves great amount of damage 
  to the nature. How many of people recycle? The answer is not so much. Thus, there is huge space to filled for recycling 
  and \textbf{Bastion The Sentinel} will help to close the gap. We are aiming for people do not waste their time for garbage 
  collecting and separating for recycling from the beginning. The purpose of creating this robot is reducing manpower in 
  garbage collecting and increasing recycling cycle for the make future better.
 \end{flushleft}
  
\section{Device Functionality}
 \begin{flushleft}
  \textbf{Bastion The Sentinel} is designed as a semi-autonomous robot. It will be a multi-tasking robot, in addition to 
  image processing abilities it can also be controlled by operator.
  In the image processing part first it will 
  consider color, if it fails perform image processing for the shape of the object.
